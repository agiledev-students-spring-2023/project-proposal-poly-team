### What and why?

What software system would you like to build this semester, and why? Include a description of what problem the system would solve and why this is important. product's value proposition.

I would like to create a web application which shows users a time table of when a bus and/or train departs from a station/terminal. This application would then allow the user to determine what is the absolute latest said user can depart from either their current or defined location and still make it to that bus/train. This software would be useful for those take a bus or train which does not run with high frequency and don't want to spend a lenghty period of time stuck inside (or even outside in the cold!) a terminal or for those trying to find at what time the last bus/train departs and subsequently the abst.

Currently, transit apps like Google Maps, NJ Transit, MYmta, etc. only tell you when a bus/train leaves and/or determine your route based on your desired time of departure or arrival. Furthermore, in all of these apps, especially, the case of the NJ Transit app the way departures are shown are somewhat unorganzied. 
For a good amount of commuters, they usually tend to have more than one bus route or train line that can take them to their destination. However, how departures are shown by either plastering the user with a list of ALL the bus routes / train lines departing from the station OR it just shows the departure times for ONE route/line. Moreover, the current apps in the market often  don't show the complete timetable for said route and instead only output the live view of when the next buses/trains are departing. In the cases where the applications due show a complete time-table, it is often hidden behind inconspicous menus and even then it only shows the time-tables for one specific route/line. 

My app would allow the user to filter the list of departures to the routes/lines which they need and from there, the app would show a combined timetable of the routes selected. Additionally, the app could also show important alerts for a line or route, such as if said a line/route has been suspended or if a scheduled departure has been cancelled. This would aler the user to current transit issues, to which they can then adapt to.


### For whom?

As a commuter student, I've ocassionally had to stay on campus late into the night working. During these late night stays in the city, I would often worry about when the last possible bus would leave the station, and if I would even make it in time. The way the current apps are designed is that there is no way to see a combined time-table for multiple lines/routes so I would often have to download, open, and analyze a multitude of different time-tables to figure when the last bus leaves. Additionally, even after finding this information, I then have to go into Google Maps or CityMapper, input my destination (the station/terminal) and the time I want to arrive there by (when the last bus is scheduled to leave) in order to get info as to what is the latest I can stay in the city.

Thus, this software is designed for the majority of commuters -- like myself -- who already know what line/route they need to take home and who occasionally, or often times need to stay in the City (or wherever they are) late into the night or for those who rely on a line/route which does not run with high frequency. This app would allow these users to worry less if they are going to make their bus and also help them save time from having to spend time at a station/terminal -- This is especially useful for those who utilize a station that is outside.

### How?

From an end-user's perspective, when they enter the website they will be presented with either a input box or with a list wherein they can specify what station they are looking for. Once the user has provided a valid input, the app would then ask the user to specify the routes/lines they'd like to be shown (it can be all routes, multiple routes, or one route). After that, the app would show a combined timetable for 

### Scope

A brief justification that the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitions for a group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to undertake in one semester.
